# Tweet-Analysis

This framework finds the top 10 hashtags of two Twitter handles, and displays them according to frequency in the form of a bar chart. The code can be easily modified to analyze other Twitter entities like user mentions, or tweet text (although an additional pre-processing step is needed). Any number of handles can be analyzed, and different charts created accordingly.
